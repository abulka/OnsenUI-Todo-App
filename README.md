# ANDY notes

The scrolling of the entire UI when drag down can be turned off by using the `<script src="inobounce.min.js"></script>`
script, however this disables the elastic scroll down of the TODO list iteself, which helps to show that you are at
the top of the list and there is nothing above - like pull to refresh.

Possibly an acceptable compromise.
